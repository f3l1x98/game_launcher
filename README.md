# game_launcher
A game launcher for Windows.
This resulted from a curiosity of mine about how one can start new processes using Dart.

**Currently WIP (refactoring of older implementation)**

# Features
- Uses 7zip for (de)installation of games
- Supports a set of game engines for easier installation
- Game save profile management
