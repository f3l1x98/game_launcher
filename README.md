# TODOs
1. Decide on a uniform form implementation(formz + bloc, flutter_form_builder, ...)
2. Split larger files into multiple widgets
3. Split models into reduced and full, with reduced used for getAll
4. Think about removing the prequel/sequel from game table into separate table with prequel_id and sequel_id columns -> only one insert necessary
